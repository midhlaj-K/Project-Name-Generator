# Project Name Generator üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Somebody


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Muhammed Midhlaj K - TKM College of Engineering

### Project Description
A chaotic Streamlit app that gives your boring project a random, over-the-top name using buzzwords from AI, food, animals, and more.This is the ultimate procrastination tool disguised as productivity.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many projects. Not enough ridiculous names.Your project deserves a name that sounds like it was created by a VC-fueled fever dream.
You can't let your proffessor think that you spent all night fixing a name.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A buzzword blender that helps you combine "Quantum" with "Toaster", or "Hyper" with "Cactus", to create names your team will never forget (or be able to explain).
