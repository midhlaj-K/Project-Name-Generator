Project Description

A chaotic Streamlit app that gives your boring project a random, over-the-top name using buzzwords from AI, food, animals, and more.This is the ultimate procrastination tool disguised as productivity.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Too many projects. Not enough ridiculous names.Your project deserves a name that sounds like it was created by a VC-fueled fever dream.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A buzzword blender that helps you combine "Quantum" with "Toaster", or "Hyper" with "Cactus", to create names your team will never forget (or be able to explain).
